code to run on border-routers

Getting a tunnel:
-----------------

NOTE securing the passwords/credentials: not sure how to do
this. Can I store the private key on the server and then issue
certificates or something? Short answer is no, a determined person
will get the keys/passwords. But I think that's ok. If you own the
password you own the license. That's my policy. I just have to make it
hard for people to steal passwords from other people.

eui and password are used to get the tunnel endpoint from the web api
gogoc is configured to use that tunnel endpoint (using mac and tunnel password)
tsp send pass with digst-md5. This will be sent a lot so we'll use a
different password.

tsps looks up the allocated subnet for the border-router and passes it along.
