Configure cloud uplinks here... some of this stuff should be moved to
lowpan or duplicated here. Would be nice for the BR to handle some of
this stuff... but probably don't want to rely on a particular BR to
get the data to where it needs to go.

So maybe this is a cloud relay config. A cloud relay is a place that
can connect your nodes to other nodes. So you are configuring lowpan
as the cloud relay. Maybe Thingsquare Mist is another relay.

<h3>Lowpan</h3>

<p>This is where you configure lowpan stuff. 

<ul>
  <li> display current lowpan config (site name tunnel config etc)
</ul>

<h3>Twitter</h3>
<p> enable and get auth to twitter feeds. This will enable posting to twitter when you select nodes

<h3>Twine</h3>
<h3>etc... etc.. all other services that are useful</h3>
